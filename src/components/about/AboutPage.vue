        Inspired by <a href="https://libs.garden/">libs.garden </a>, which used
        to send newsletters weekly for subscribers.
      </p>
      <p>
        But later, it seems there is something wrong with this website, I didn't
        get weekly newsletters any more. I really enjoy reading the tech
        trending for open source repositories, so I wrote an email to the
        maintainer of libs.garden on 2019 (forget how to find him), in replied
        email he said that he won't get time to fix it.

        On 2022 I just learn some cloud based development on aws, and some front
        end vue3, the best way to practice them is to launch a project using all
        the learned techniques. So it comes to me that I should do a similar
        website using aws as backend and vue as front end.

        Now this is what you see, the domain name - asgithub - stands for
        awesome github. I spent lots of leisure time on doing it, so, if you
        like it, please star on github
        <a href="https://github.com/ajeecai/awesome-github-ui" target="_blank"
          >awesome-github-ui </a
        >and<a
          href="https://github.com/ajeecai/awesome-github-srv"
          target="_blank"
        >
          awesome-github-srv</a
        >.
      </p>

        So far I am not a seasoned UI coder, especially not good at CSS and
        design layout. If you find any issues or improvement ideas, go ahead to
        file an issue in github or send PR.

      <p>Code for fun, imagine a world!</p>
